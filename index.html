          <p> Lately, I've been enjoying a break from Windows and have been on a Mac
            focusing on front-end JavaScript development with AngularJS and open-source
            tools like Git, Node.js, Grunt, Bower, Yeoman, Sass, and Compass. I'm
            also focused on internationalization and localization of AngularJS apps.

                  <p> I founded <a href="http://rescateer.com/">Rescateer, LLC</a> with
                    the mission to create more useful social applications using the

                  <p> The social graph on platforms such as Facebook holds amazing potential
                    for really useful applications. Despite these platforms' maturity
                    popular applications center on games for entertainment. I'd love
                    to eventually see many popular apps that help people collaborate,
                    communicate, develop deeper relationships, save time, etc. </p>
                  <p> <a href="https://memoryfusion.org">MemoryFusion.org</a> is our
                    most feature-rich app. It is bringing friends and family on Facebook
                    together around family history stories. We know that family history
                    is a large market where there are many users looking for social
                    applications beyond entertainment. We launched it in September
                    2014 and we look forward to seeing users contribute content in
                    the coming weeks. </p>
                  <p> We do recognize that it's human nature to enjoy play. As our apps
                    evolve they will likely use gamification to engage users more&mdash;striking
                    a balance between entertainment and utility. </p>

                  </p>
                  <p> I worked for a small software company. The flagship product was
                    PHX ModelCenter®&mdash;a modeling and simulation environment
                    used primarily in industries such as aerospace, defense, automotive,
                    turbomachinery and heavy industry to improve the engineering
                    design process through process automation, design exploration
                    and multidisciplinary optimization. </p>
                  <p> I developed software including leading development of key features
                    of PHX ModelCenter®. I also worked with customers performing
                    training, custom software development, consulting and support.
                  </p>
                  <p> My formal titles included Lead Developer, Software Engineer, Senior

            My graduate specialization included cross-functional approaches for successful
            product development. </p>

          <h2>myNextGear</h2>
          <p class="lead well"> <a href="https://mynextgear.com/">myNextGear</a> is an AngularJS financial
            application for car dealerships. A mobile version is also supported in
            <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mynextgear/id748609885?mt=8">iTunes</a>            and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nextgear.mobile&hl=en">Google play</a>.
          </p>
          <p> My contributions to the myNextGear application included playing a critical
            role in internationalizing and localizing the application for an important
            launch to the French Canadian market. I also played a major role in putting
            in place a continuous integration process using <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/bamboo">Bamboo</a>.
            Additionally, I took part in improvements such as <a href="http://www.autoremarketing.com/subprime/nextgear-integrates-kbb-values-within-apps">
            Kelley Blue Book integration
        </a> and putting testing environments in place using tools such as Protractor
            and Frisby.js. </p>
          <h2>Memory Fusion</h2>
          <p class="lead well"> <a href="https://memoryfusion.org/">MemoryFusion.org</a> is a responsive
            web application that provides social, real-time family history story
            collaboration. </p>
          <p> It features a real-time editor for writing family history stories, tools
            to discover and read stories, and Facebook sharing. </p>
          <p> Users log in with Facebook Login. They can write new stories or read stories
            published by others. When writing a new story, they can share the link
            via Facebook and edit the story in real time with other collaborators.
            Users can provide metadata about the story such as the date, place, people
            and other tags. This metadata is also synced for all collaborators during
            editing and can also be used later to search published stories. </p>
          <p> Several views are provided for managing story drafts and for searching
            for stories to read. A feed view displays the latest stories in a familiar
            social feed layout. A table view allows for searching stories based on
            any metadata property. A thumbnail view fills the screen with images
            and story descriptions similar to Pinterest but with more emphasis on
            the textual content. </p>
          <p> Memory Fusion was built with my standard web technology stack. One of the
            key development challenges was managing access rights to the stories
            since there are three levels of privacy that can be set (private, Facebook
            friends, public). Another development challenge was the authentication
            and authorization components that had to play nice with Facebook Login,
            a stateless Web API and the real-time collaboration. </p>
          <h2>Simply Status</h2>
          <p class="lead well"> Simply Status is Facebook.com web application for desktop (canvas application)
            that provides a more concise Facebook news feed. </p>
          <p> It reads your news feed and only shows you status updates from your friends.
            It utilizes local browser storage to cache Facebook API calls to conserve
            bandwidth and make the app faster. </p>
          <h2>SOS Friend Alert</h2>
          <p class="lead well"> SOS Friend alert is another Facebook.com web application for desktop that
            searches your Facebook news feed and friend timelines and looks for keywords
            and phrases that might be important. Important statuses (alerts) are
            highlighted for you and brought to the top of your feed. </p>
          <p> It uses regular expressions for its searches which provides a very efficient
            way to perform searches. However, since there is no additional intelligence
            the user can expect a lot of false positives in the results. </p>
          <p>
            The main technical challenge in this application is that Facebook can suddenly reject
            what it may consider excessive API calls. However, there is no hard limit
            on this. Therefore, the app has to throttle API calls to avoid failure.
            </p>
          <h2>An Interview Scheduling App</h2>
          <p> Early in 2014 I developed an interview scheduling web application for a
            local organization. The application makes it much easier for clients
            to schedule interviews (replaces an ad hoc email approach) and reduces
            incidents of missed appointments and misinformation. Thus, it has significantly
            reduced the administrative burden and increased the customer service
            level. </p>
          <p> The application allows clients to schedule their own appointments directly.
            It sends automated email reminders the day of the appointment. It provides
            an ICalendar (ics) feed for the interviewers that can be used from any
            common calendar app on a mobile device. </p>
          <p> The application uses SendGrid for email notifications and Azure Table Storage
            (NoSQL) for its backend data storage. </p>
          <p> One challenging aspect of the application is the handling of time zones.
            Commonly in applications the local time for the user is displayed but
            for this case the local time for the location for the interviews is displayed.
          </p>
          <p> Probably the most complex aspect of the site is the two authentication
            options. The first involves a modified Facebook Login flow which requires
            a typical Facebook Login augmented with a query from the server to Facebook
            (using the Graph API) to verify their membership in one of the organization's
            Facebook groups. At this point in the login flow, if the user is not
            a member of one of the approved Facebook groups, the administrator is
            emailed with the user’s contact information so that he can verify their
            membership and add the user to the approved Facebook group. Meanwhile
            the user can still prove membership in the organization and immediately
            authenticate by providing a URL to their organizational profile&mdash;if
            it is connected to their Facebook profile, then they are authenticated.
          </p>
          <p> The second login flow allows the users to provide an organizational user
            name and password that is authenticated via a public endpoint with their
            main organization’s web site. </p>
          <p> Since a user may only have a Facebook account or an organization account,
            both authentication methods are provided. </p>
          <h2>A Modeling & Simulation App</h2>
          <p> Late in 2013 I lead a small team to develop a single page web application
            for a large corporation. The application aims to significantly decrease
            the time it takes for running simulations and provides a dashboard for
            viewing results. I developed a custom single page application framework
            using Knockout.js for the project. On the server side there were a few
            interesting features including integration with Phoenix Integration software
            such as PHX ModelCenter® to run simulations and a real-time API for clients
            to receive simulation progress updates. </p>

          <p> I've also just started trainings on PluralSight and plan to complete several
            assessments in the coming weeks to show my current knowledge and to continue
            learning new skills. </p>
